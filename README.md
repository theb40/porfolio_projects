# Porfolio projects
A collection of my personal projects catered for employers

*CS50's cap stone project:
This project is the most recent one, showcasing some of my understanding in database designing and optimizing. [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) is a brief summary of all my design choices, as well as explaination for all the extablished relationships. The [schema](schema.sql) contains all of the database's source code, including all tables, indexes and triggers. Some common queries for this table can be found [here](queries.sql).
