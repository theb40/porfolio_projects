# Porfolio projects
A collection of my personal projects catered for employers

## CS50's capstone project:
This project is the most recent one, showcasing some of my understanding in database designing and optimizing. [**DESIGN.md**](DESIGN.md) is a brief summary of all my design choices, as well as explaination for all the established relationships. The [**schema**](schema.sql) contains all of the database's source code, including all tables, indexes and triggers. Some common queries for this table can be found [**here**](queries.sql).

## Google Data Analytics Capstone project and COVID 19 data exploration:
Both of these projects were created at the beginning of my journey as a data analyst, showcasing my earlier understanding in query design and data analytic. While some of the queries are not very well optimized, they can still be valuable as a reflection of my journey so far. You can view these projects by downloading the respective files and open them with your browser of choice.

## Other Python/C problem sets solutions:
I'm currently working on a web application project with an integrated data pipeline using Python(Flask + PySpark), and looking forward to published this summer, 2025. In the meanstime, my experience in Python and C can be proven with my solutions to various course-related problem sets, but due to course's academic honesty policy, they can not be published. If you are interested at me as a potential candidate, I am willing to provide them privately through email: **theb40hcm@gmail.com**. My sincere apology for the inconvinience.
